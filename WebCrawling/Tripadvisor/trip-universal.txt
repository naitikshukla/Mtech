Asif I|None|11 August 2017|Get the Express ticket!!!!|4|C34E8657C38B12E7D8EFAFE0423ACFC1|Very long queues for all rides. Transformer ride the queue was nearly 2hours long. It was a very good ride but not sure if the two hours was worth it!So much to do and see but the queues made it impossible and exhausting. Food and drinks were expensive! We hired out a wheelchair as the kids got tired and found it difficult to walk.
summershineR|Manila- Philippines|11 August 2017|March is a not so busy month|5|1D08AEC256AC4561DDB5177DA7C9AC78|Going to universal studios is worth every penny !!! We love the food hour it was hot but it was awesome and the rides as well
roryjdoyle|Kuala Lumpur- Malaysia|11 August 2017|Terrible Queues|2|53914737C20758B841D5356ED067D5B1|Terrible queues from the minute you arrive to collect or pay for your tickets until you leave! You can buy an express pass to cut queues but that will cost an additional $100 per person. Rip off.
Febiehung|Sydney- Australia|11 August 2017|Compact for young kids|4|E6912B14388BE7923F67DF5E4AC3929E|Great place for young kids but it was a bit too hot when queuing outdoor under the sun... There can be more air-conditioned waiting queue.
alancsimy|Kuala Lumpur- Malaysia|11 August 2017|Family visit|5|967D16A3CADED7C6C290C15FF4A5C084|Huge park. price is expensive. long queue n take an hour n more to get in/on one attraction to another i.e. roller coaster/001 3D ride boat transformer etc. etc. Make sure you're really brave n dare to go on roller coaster.... open your both eyes n feel your heart beat. ... ooooowwwww.... hahahaahaa
Paulina922|None|10 August 2017|Amazing place!|5|27F7FC8308B3B2A0E09847EDC80B6913|This UNIVERSAL is of course much smaller from Muami`s/001 but it really worth to visit it. Nice scenery and games. It worths to buy EXPRESS TICKET/001 I think its 70S$ more but the lines are too big to wait... Except from that the island has so many other things to do (like aquarium) that it really worth to visit it!P.S. Don't forget to visit Transformers and Mummy's roller coaster!
MN8888|Liverpool- United Kingdom|10 August 2017|Expensive and very crowded|2|AD233A522C4B687BE64FF1C8238AE1F2|We went as a family in August and it was very crowded. The security and ticket queue took an hour when we arrived at 10.30We bought the unlimited express at an extra 100 per person and this proved to be worth it as it would cut the queues by half for all rides.We managed to do over 12 rides spending about 7 hours there And thr kids did enjoy the rides The worst bit was lunchtime where the lunch prak time was so crowded and queues again took over an hour again to get any foodCrowd control could be better managed and the park is a lot smaller than Disneyland parks
teodorspanu|Ploiesti- Romania|10 August 2017|A way to spend couple of hours|3|D2F49137EDD85C7AF6DA3C57D6173AC2|A quite overated place. Few really interesting attraction and very crowded. Long queues after 12.00. At least 1/0015-2 hrs to stay in line. Too expensive for what you get!
Jonnytwosocks|Dubai- United Arab Emirates|10 August 2017|Good day but not the best|3|0DB2C3614504C7262B1F5517017A1EC6|We visited the theme park and booked online suffice to say we still stood 55 mins to collect tkts/001 then when we asked how much express lane tkts are he tried to rip us off. Be careful here! The park is really limited and mostly for children... 10-15. There are very few big rides/001 but four are worth while. Its small/001 expensive/001 and very limited. We were done in less than 4 hours for 300 Brit pounds! Your decision guys?
JMMenace|Dunshaughlin- Ireland|8 August 2017|Good day out|4|083FDDEC681EDBB2332E89D566675D21|Its as good as USA park but still worth a visit.There are a good selection of rides and roller coasters if your into that/001 3D and 4D rides are also very good.It can be very hot and humid here so be warned. Good selection of restaurants/001 etc.
AmilaX|Colombo- Sri Lanka|8 August 2017|Great times!|4|5F030F832407DC3AD85CB6F4626F2A86|Come early as possible (8am) and buy tickets online( cheaper). be prepared to spend at least 5-6 hours and Loooooong Qs. Food and merchandise are higly expensive .
tarit1979|Gurugram (Gurgaon)- India|8 August 2017|A Disneyland replica|4|5DB3C5FB75F7EB06896E73E6A1757C66|We went to this theme park after a year of visiting Disneyland in HK. Seemed as if we were re-visiting the place again. rides/001 4D movies/001 live shows etc. Good for kids. Do not go on weekends & late in the day. The queues at the rides are just too long. But if you want to have food then this place has got loads of options. Wish we had same parks in India.
Anne A|Reading|8 August 2017|Fantastic day|5|23D07305AE16D96C0873C7D54026255A|We were able to get tickets at the gate with a fairly short queue. Worth waiting as we got senior priced tickets. Thoroughly enjoyed the shows and the rides we chose to go on. Plenty of food areas and places to buy drinks.
simonedls24|Paranaque- Philippines|8 August 2017|Universal Studio Singapore is amazing!!!|5|181BC3724DE5E6AC535C5559EB31BB63|Universal was awesome!!! Buy a fast pass if you plan to go on a weekend!!! My kid was happy with the minions and the rides! I was amazed with the water world show!!! Must visit when in Singapore!!!
rearcardoor|Northampton- United Kingdom|7 August 2017|USS with 3 kids|4|922F897EBCE80934A0BB665BDE7B51FF|This is a great theme park but a few things stop it getting a 5 star/001 which I'll explain later. We took an Uber to the Casino drop off point (inside a big car park) and from there there is a simple escalator to Sentosa. It saves costs getting across to the island and is a quick way in.Once off the escalator you are at the entrance to USS. If you have tickers then join the queue else visit a yello ticketing booth. The queues may be long but they move quite quickly. It is expensive and costs about 350USD for two adults and three kids aged 12 and under. What was really expensive was the express upgrade which was 100USD per head/001 so much more than the actual ticket price. So 850USD later we entered the park.It is really well laid out in a big circle split into a number of different zones. There aren't a massive number of rides but enough to spend a good day here. In the AM/001 the queues were ridiculous/001 up to 110 minutes for some of the most popular rides and even with the express tickets it was up to 20 minutes. The guys checking entry to the express lanes often exaggerated the wait times though/001 often saying 40 minutes when it was really 20.After 3 o'clock the queues were much shorter and most of the time you could walk straight to the front with the express ticket and even the standard ticket queues weren't too long.The quality of the rides is good and my favourite was Transformers/001 followed by the Ceylon ride (Battlestar Galactica grey loop - the red Human one wasn't so good)/001 then the Mummy. The rapids was also quite well done.We managed to do all of the rides/001 some 3 times/001 in one day.There are so many rest rooms/001 ice cream and drink stops and eateries but dond't surprised to have to pay 16USD for a hotdog. Most queues have water fountains and there are plenty of places to top up your water bottles/001 which you must take!Several of the thrill rides do not allow any bags/001 wallets or phones and they do provide lockers/001 free for the first 35 minutes or so.Make sure you visit the Spielberg movie set which simulates a hurricane/001 this was excellent and is right near the entrance.I do feel that it is a little expensive and they probably sell too many tickets in the AM as the queues were too long. I would maybe consider heading straight to the opposite side of the park and doing some of the less busy rides in the AM/001 saving the thrill rides for the PM when the queues are smaller.There is a free monorail back to the mainland/001 but we took the monorail to Imbiah and got the cable car back to harbour front/001 which was fun/001 but again not cheap. We did have a great day.
amichemie2016|Mumbai (Bombay)- India|7 August 2017|A thrilling day spent at USS|5|B8D82ECEBA92CC4953AA12C07B975EB4|Purchase online tickets that will save your cost. Start early so that you reach early and dont need to wait in long queues. After 4 pm the queues get shorter. So you may come there late also. There are a variety of rides to experience. I loved the Transformer ride. Pls do not miss it. There are two kinds of Roller Coaster ride - Human and Gallactica. Human is lil easy as compared to gallatica. There are six zones like EZYPT/001 MADAGASCAR/001 HOLLYWOOD/001 FAR FAR AWAY/001 JURASSIC PARK/001 SCI-FI CITY. It is a full day activity.
billCarmel_NewYork|Carmel- New York|7 August 2017|Worst universal of them all|2|80C16101FB4733C8E3747B5B47A08E4D|We have been to the other parks/001 Orlando and Hollywood/001 and by far this park( Singapore) is the worst I have ever seen. There is a problem with crowd control/001 they do not have enough staff to properly handle the crowds. From the entry gate to the rides there is a visible staff shortage. The rides are not properly staffed/001 causing a back log in the ride times. The Mummy ride for instance they do not stage the next car ahead of time they wait till it's already in/001 wasting time and efficiency. Same experience with Jurassic park ride. And it continues with the food service and etc.
frequenttraveller705|Lucena City- Philippines|7 August 2017|Long queues|2|306C9994E471B225F87D935244FC1A9E|Soent much of our time standing in long queues because of the universal express ticket. This is one form of discrimination. Two tickets for the same show. Terrible
JattConnoisseur|London- United Kingdom|6 August 2017|Felt like a kid again! |5|22312C87847118B73FE810142E0A11F9|Great fun here! I felt like a kid again. Had so much fun! Definitely a must visit place in Singapore.
trevelyon|oakland|6 August 2017|Weak compared to Los Angeles|3|B4EAFD9106B553928BFAEA7A2741CC03|Checked this place out with my 16 year old. It was just ok. Compared to Los Angeles/001 this place was like a small carnival you see at malls. We paid for the express passes to avoid the lines/001 which i recommend. The main roller coster was kind of boring. I noticed this place was kind of small. I expected a huge theme park. Worth checking out if your in Singapore but dont expect Los Angeles or Florida.
davidoM6483OP|None|6 August 2017|visiting sentosa park|4|6D661FC98E424D22739CAD5F8ACBE700|we took the MRT to the stop for sentosa island. i would recommend buying tickets on line to avoid the first of many queues. also the extra $100 per person for premium access/001 whilst expensive/001 is worth it. 2 years ago we visited and being a single rider got you onto the ride quickly without shelling out the extra money. nowadays the crowds are so big that even as a single rider you will wait up to 40 minutes. the other thing to do is to take plenty of water. on a hot day you can dehydrate quickly. also - don't miss the water world show. it is a must see!! it fills up very quickly.
Naser A|None|6 August 2017|Amazing Place!|5|6CBEEAABA5A5B6BE585448DA2444CC99|This is really a great place to enjoy/001 from the youngest to the eldest...Have all kind of rides.. I was here with my 3 kids... 10yrs/001 8yrs and 5yrs.. We really enjoyed all.. The best in my opinion is the/001 Transformers The ride/001 and the Battlestar Galactica in sci.fi section.. And the Revenge of Mummy in Egypt section..Don't miss the shows.. Have many..My favorite specially for kids is the Sesame Street : when i grow up..Don't go in peak season/001 if you go in peak season as i did.. I recommend buying the Express Universal Pass..So you and your family or friends will skip all the long que. And you will have the priority.. It costs $70 singapore dollar per person.. And you can use it as you like for many rides..
Karen F|kerikeri|6 August 2017|Fun for all ages|5|49A3C0E5D8E2243E9F189815CDB425D6|We got there early and there were hardly any queues for the rides. So we had an absolute ball/001 trying the rides. Lots to buy/001 do and see. This is my current favourite theme park. I really loved all the themed areas to visit. New York had some amazing street dancers who invited members from the audience to dance too. It was fun. The Water show was spectacular with explosions and lots of water! Be warned- if you sit in the front seats you will get wet. The place was clean/001 inviting and fun. I can't wait to go again.
senakicir|Lausanne- Switzerland|5 August 2017|Great Rides!|5|DC48A1FA78DD5EA6A7F0F0B41EB8FB13|This place has some amazing rides and very nice details (Far Far Away might be my favorite area of the park). My favorites were Transformers/001 Cylon and Mummy/001 in that order. I did not buy a six month pass and a single day was enough for me. Luckily I had a friend who knew the park and the queues very well and he managed to get us on almost all of the rides within a single day. If you don't plan well though you may not be able to fit all the attractions into a single day.A little tip: The Battlestar Galactica themed ride usually has a very long line - especially Cylon. It is amazing though and you should not miss out on it. So I recommend that you go on this ride as soon as the park opens.
Donzgel|Cabuyao- Philippines|5 August 2017|Amazing rides!|5|F82B85BA788E8CAD1AFB91B8965D9937|A must-visit in Singapore! Transformers The Ride was super duper COOL!!! We waited in line for almost 2hrs and it's super worth it! This ride became my instant fave! Lol. Waterworld/001 The Mummy/001 Jurassic Park and Cylon are also a must! To save up some waiting time on the rides/001 you need to go here during weekdays though.
kalleviken|Stockholm|5 August 2017|So expensive and suits younger children|3|D37DC7A326CB780315C9EED90B0AE472|Spent a day in the park with our 13 & 14yr old children and it was beautiful and also very expensive. Fast pass 70$ per person! The rides are not that thrilling so teenagers might be a bit (or very) disappointed. Two areas does not open until 11 so don't be too early. Two rides also closed for several hours. Many rides don't accept any bags/mobile in your pockets or hats etc so you have to pay for a locker (another 10$) each time you realise that. Stunt show is very violent/001 not suitable for kids under 15 I would say. Transformers ride the same! Not so sure who this park is for ? It got more quiet by the end of the day with very short queues.
stefanuswisnu|None|5 August 2017|Time to play and have fun|4|C69540189BFA5B16FD8BCC22A3EBCCCA|very easy to reach this place by the MRT. Various attractions available take your time and beware of the holiday season cause it will be very fully loaded with kids. don't forget/001 Singapore is always hot.
Prabhat G|None|5 August 2017|The best day with family! Look out for coupons!|5|81D5495EA82E5FB26FACB36E83D3D8CD|I was recommended by my friend to visit universal studios as she had been to the park in America and had heard that Singapore was also worth a visit. When looking through some leaflets that you get when arriving at Singapore airport I spotted some coupons that would get entry cheaper so keep your eyes peeled! We set out mixed with adults and young children and from the get go I was really impressed with the whole presentation of the park. We went on a few rides: transformers/001 mummy/001 Jurassic park all of which were absolutely fantastic/001 100% worth the wait of the queues which were about an hour. The water show is also very good/001 highly recommend. We finished the day watching Sherk 4D which was fun and then a beautiful firework show which happens at time 2030.I highly recommend a day out here with the family.
Ariba T|New Delhi- India|5 August 2017|NIce place but overcrowded|3|53667C41A338C65FE6E5CD55D45C2911|A very nice place with an average experience as it was overcrowded and its very difficult to get access to all the rides without standing in long queues. We reached the place at 10:30 and could finish only 2 rides by 3:30. We finally decided to skip all rides and just look around the place. Food is also expensive inside but you will find a lot of eating options for Kids . It strongly recommend that you buy express pass at the entrance which will be very helpful. To give you an idea the waiting time for transformers ride was 1hr 40 mins for us.
David N|Tathra- Australia|5 August 2017|Long queues  limited number of rides  little actual movie memorabilia|3|FA76942FB60A2C88323201D3A47EF432|If you have been to Universal Studios in California/001 or Movie World on the Gold Coast then you are going to be disappointed. On the other hand/001 if you haven't (neither my wife or 11 year old had) then you'll think it's OK. Most of the queues are at least an hour long. There is an express ticket you can buy for an extra ~$50 but I feel that is a bit rich on top of general admission. Transformers is a very good 3D simulation ride. The Jurassic Park raft ride fun and safe. I thought the Madagascar raft ride and the vintage car ride were fairly lame but very small children would probably enjoy it. It can be VERY hot in the middle of the day.
Stuffandthings|Perth- Australia|5 August 2017|If you value your sanity...|4|68C7D6B758CE51D01C66B8F8A5155824|Ok/001 I wish someone had told me these simple tips to avoid crowds (and looooong queues)before I went: 1. Make sure you don't go on a Singapore Holiday or school break. 2. Go on a Monday or Tuesday 3. Any other day: invest in a skip the line pass. Just do it! So worth it if you value your sanity! 4. Don't miss the Transformers ride. You can thank me later.
Amit P|London- United Kingdom|5 August 2017|Good but requires some improvement in service|3|A4B936D27AF1D4C39970A8C2051F255A|We bought our tickets online from a third party retailor called headout.com which was a mistake. Do not do this. Their website talks about express entry however when you get there you have to que again out side guest services to get your tickets and then que again to be let into the park so there's no express entry. Our friends you just turned up on the day and bought at the kiosk got faster service. I had bought a ticket groom headout.com for my 3 year old. My mistake as she didn't need one. I was told this when I got to guest services at universal studios. They couldn't give me a refund as they had accidentlu already printed the ticket. They asked me not to use the ticket and speak with headout.com I'm fortunately headout.com say they can't do anything and universal studios Singapore arnt getting back to my emails. So the moral of the story is just buy your tickets on the door. It works out cheaper and quicker. The rides were good and out small children enjoyed it. We bought express line upgrades which we used a little however these upgrades are really useful for the bigger rides that really small children wont enjoy.Saying that queuing in a normal que can be brutal for some rides.The western style food was poor. In Mel's dinner there was no vegetarian option amongst the burgers. In a city what is supposed to be international and culturally diverse and also has some great eating options at such a competitive price Mel's dinner in universal studios is a real let down!! Please provide a vegetarian option. The rides are good. Buy your ticket at the door. Consider the express pass if your kids are over 7 or 7 and want to go on the bigger rides. Try yo leave the complex and go out side for lunch (there s lots of good cheaper options just outside) if you must eat inside try one of oriental style food courts in the lost world area.
Om P|New Delhi- India|4 August 2017|Amazing Place|5|11B2BB7F2C9B6C3D67CCFD9511381182|We had a great time here. 4 year old daughter just loved it. We reached at opening time/001 took the unlimited fast pass which was totally worth it as our daughter wanted to do many rides repetitively. Food is average. The attractions / shows were too good.
jdjv1020|Liverpool- United Kingdom|4 August 2017|Good day out|4|288D890D86A7C129BEB943D7F10A066B|Brilliant day out which caters for all. The 3 main rides are worth the $70 alone.Had a couple of downpours which is expected but the rides will continue. The rides are only stopped when there is a risk of lightening which is good.
JSydAUSTRALIA|Sydney- Australia|4 August 2017|What a fantastic time!|5|F4C527ED3CB499BAEA63E96310E95B55|Obviously if you travel with kids they앏l have a blast/001 but if you go on your own too. It압 got all the attractions as per current movies/001 plus great roller coasters. If you go in the "Cyclone" don앖 do it just after breakfast. It압 a really powerful roller coaster/001 scary but good fun. In terms of queues expect avarage of 40 minutes on a weekend. I bought the "express card" for $80 at 10 am and I was basically jumping in and out attractions without waiting. The price changes as per demand/001 so the sooner you get it/001 the better.At Jurasic Park you앏l probably get your shoes wet. There압 a coin operator drying station but you can also go to a toilet and use the machine for drying hands. Leave your shoes there a few minutes and you앏l be ready to go in no time.Most attractions that involve sudden movements require you to leave all your belongings in a locker. There seemed to be lots of confusion on how to use them. THis is what you do:- Go to where the lockers are and use of the computers there. Select "Rent locker".- You앏l see a place where to put your finger. Use your thumb once or twice (check what the screen tells you) and once your fingerprints are stored/001 the computer will assign you a locker. - Locate that locker/001 put all inside/001 and close it holding it for 3 seconds till you hear the actual locking mechanism.- Go and have fun.- Once you are done/001 go to any computer at the locker place and select "Open locker". You don앖 need to remember your locker number. Once you put your finger again/001 it앏l recognise your fingerprints/001 open the locker and show you on the screen your locker number. That압 all/001 locate it and clear it. There is no cost for the first 40 minutes.- At Jurasic Parc/001 lockers are not free.There are many options for food and coffee everywhere.Great place!
ywlim297|None|4 August 2017|Always a good experience |5|96D1BACB69594AFEC53D8128AC9DAD31|As we stay in Singapore/001 we enjoy visiting USS frequently. It is always an amazing time for us. However/001 there can be a long wait for rides so we would recommend using the express pass if you would like to try all of the rides.
khunnoomay|Bangkok|4 August 2017|A GREAT fun|5|63A0FEC9F3ED56F6C6F898DCEA607989|With the Minions Break Out party event/001 it is a must to bring your little ones to enjoy a full day of rides/001 shows and fun. It got very very hot throughout the day.. prepare small fan and bottle of water! Toilet is clean and conveniently available.
venkatprabhu74|Singapore- Singapore|4 August 2017|Lots of attractions  kids will enjoy|5|3F04343CD19E9EFA08E1E54DF012A565|There are lots of themes to see/001 there are rides for all age group... some good restaurant for quick bites. Kids will correlate some the stories they studied at school. Don't miss if you travel with kids
UrMajesty C|Dubai- United Arab Emirates|4 August 2017|fun visit|5|D0A1D055C810D5F8E9A9BC116CEB5EFF|we had so much fun with most of the rides. i suggest to read some blogs about Universal Studio SG then get ideas where to go the moment ur in. comfy clothes & shoes is a must.
