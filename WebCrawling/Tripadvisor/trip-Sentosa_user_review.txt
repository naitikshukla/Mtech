billCarmel_NewYork|80C16101FB4733C8E3747B5B47A08E4D|Restaurant|Singapore: Pizza Express|2| “I don't know why so many good reviews”|review_510034441|Tried this place just tonight, based on the good reviews, big mistake. First, service was horrendous, no dedicated host/hostess leaving it to the wait staff, just made it confusing when trying to sit people at the proper table, we had ours switched 3 times by 2 different people before we even sat down. The pizza's were ok just passable as a pizza, the margarita pizza was a disappointment not a true margarita, but a plain pizza with one basil leaf dropped on top. We also tried the carbonara pizza, again disappointed on how not crispy the crust was. During our meal we ordered another item, which we waited and waited on, finally asked about it, and that person had no clue, the staff is the problem to many people trying to do too many things, hosting, sitting people,taking orders, delivering food etc..creates problems and slows service down which was evident tonight. The lasagna saved it from a terrible rating, that was pretty decent.

There is a problem with crowd control, they do not have enough staff to properly handle the crowds. From the entry gate to the rides there is a visible staff shortage. The rides are not properly staffed, causing a back log in the ride times. The Mummy ride for instance they do not stage the next car ahead of time they wait till it's already in, wasting time and efficiency. Same experience with Jurassic park ride. And it continues with the food service and etc.

One of the few hotels in Manhattan with an indoor pool which came in handy the second day since it was raining, it gave the kids something to do for a while. Also there is a Turkish bath and spa on premise.The staff were extremely nice and professional. The location was perfect with a parking garage right next door which they will valet for you, and with a subway station right on the corner, perfect for getting around town.
billCarmel_NewYork|80C16101FB4733C8E3747B5B47A08E4D|Restaurant|Boston: Dolce Vita|5| “Great gem in the north end”|review_409780138|Came tonight on friends recommendation, and was not dissappointed. The place has a nice cozy feeling, and the owner Frank is a pure gentleman. It was like going to eat at your Italian grandmother's kitchen. Our meals were all perfectly prepared and delicious. I had the seafood rigatoni which was abundant in seafood, lobster,scallops,and shrimp. My wife had the portabella mushrooms with shrimp cavitelli, another tasty dish. We will definitely be coming back on our next visit to Boston.

billCarmel_NewYork|80C16101FB4733C8E3747B5B47A08E4D|Restaurant|Boston: Legal Harborside|5| “Dinner on the water”|review_409291362|Went for dinner last night, and we were not dissappointed. My tuna steak was cooked perfectly and was impressed with the choice of side dishes they had on hand. Both my kids enjoyed the food selection as well there is something there on the menu for everyone.
billCarmel_NewYork|80C16101FB4733C8E3747B5B47A08E4D|Restaurant|Lake George: The Lobster Pot|3| “Food is over rated and dissapointing”|review_399309669|Was there last night for dinner, the wait staff is fine the problem is the food. We started with the calamari, which was ok, the problem was the marinara sauce it was served with tasted more like ketchup with a bit of chopped basil sprinkled on it than marinara. The martinis were served in less than an average sized martini glass again disappointing since the drink itself was good. Entree's came I had ordered the surf and turf, strip steak medium rare and jumbo shrimp scampi. When it came the steak was over cooked to well past medium, not very flavorful as if it was not seasoned, and the 4 jumbo shrimp scampi were 4 medium sized shrimp in a white garlic type sauce, not a scampi, accompanying veggies again seemed very bland no seasoning, tasting like the came out of a frozen bag. My wife had the steamers which she said were OK, and the lobster tail along with the same veggies and baked potato. The positives were the wait staff and the outdoor seating which was nice. The negatives was how poorly the food was prepared.

billCarmel_NewYork|80C16101FB4733C8E3747B5B47A08E4D|Hotel|San Francisco: The Alise - A Staypineapple Hotel|5| “A true gem in the heart of SF”|review_367910188|I had the pleasure of staying at this property last week. I visited the hotel last year pre renovation and all I can say is what a transformation! Quintessential boutique hotel conveniently located a couple of blocks from Union Square. Lobby is bright and cheery. Rooms are elegantly appointed and décor vibrant and has a high-end feel giving you the feeling of luxury. My favorite part is the bed - I've stayed in many hotels and Hotel Grace has the most comfortable beds. Now on to the service.... I was away from my family, and the whole staff - from the General Manager - Graham, to the bell staff Ricky and William - made me feel at home and part of their family. Graham is always visible greeting guests. William and Ricky were both super friendly. Angie at the front desk was very helpful as well during my stay.Restaurant is still in the works but there are many places around to eat.I will definitely stay here again next time I am in town.

It was probably one of the best observation experiences the city has to offer. Great views of the Empire State building..met life building..times Square. We went at night to see the lights and the lines were short at about 8:45pm.
billCarmel_NewYork|80C16101FB4733C8E3747B5B47A08E4D|Restaurant|New York City: Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse|4| “Meat Mecca”|review_349542996|Went here with the family for a weekend dinner. We were not dissappointed. The service was attentive and down to earth. The selections of meats were great, sausage, rack of lamb, leg of lamb,pork loin, chicken,different cuts of steaks all very flavorful. Kids 6 and under are free and kids 7 to 12 are half off. The wine and cocktail selections are pretty decent with something for every budget.

Even with the bad winter of little natural snow there was plenty of the man made stuff to have a lot of terrain for all abilities. The gondola was a plus on the coldest day of the year. We were with a group that the kids ranged in age from 7 to 15 and had a blast. The lodge area had plenty of room and plenty of food choices to satisfy everyone.
billCarmel_NewYork|80C16101FB4733C8E3747B5B47A08E4D|Restaurant|New York City: Joe's Shanghai|3| “Rude staff but food good”|review_329782391|Was here for lunch. The wait staff was grumpy rude and pushy. The food makes up for the service. But at the end they try to force a bigger tip out of you saying you have to tell them the amount to charge your card before they swipe it and the conveniently list the tips 20% and higher. They said their machine does not work like most other restaurants, seemed a bit of scam, just leave cash.
billCarmel_NewYork|80C16101FB4733C8E3747B5B47A08E4D|Restaurant|Mahopac: Ramiro's 954|2| “Good food lousy service ”|review_328389245|I have to say the food is good but i was very disappointed with the service. We had a reservation for dinner at 8pm on friday night for dinner. We get there on time takes them about 10 minutes to get us a table..ok i get it was a busy friday night no big deal but there is no communication between hostess and wait staff. The hostess was taking us to a table but all of a sudden another couple who came in after us gets seated at the table we were supposed to have by a waitress...so now we have to wait again for another table for a couple of minutes. Then we get seated and it takes over 10 minutes for our waiter to come over to us, even though he saw us get seated and passed by several times checking on his other tables. This experience just ruined the meal for me.

The food is ok nothing great. The bar food is good such as the wings and burgers. The bar section is large with music and karaoke. I say try it at least once.
billCarmel_NewYork|80C16101FB4733C8E3747B5B47A08E4D|Restaurant|Carmel: Greek Village Restaurant|5| “Great..go to spot”|review_318696301|Hidden little gem in putnam plaza. Standard diner food with great greek specialties. This is my sons favorite diner in the area and they have something for everyone. The atomic wings are a must have as well as the gyros. Never had a bad meal in this place. The wait staff is very friendly and make you feel at home.

Its the consistency in the quality of the sushi that keeps bringing us back. The staff is always very welcoming making you feel like family.
billCarmel_NewYork|80C16101FB4733C8E3747B5B47A08E4D|Restaurant|Mahopac: il Laghetto|2| “If only the food was as good as the view”|review_307366464|We decided to try this place as it used to be the terrace club which for a while was a really good place then it just got horrible. We saw its name changed and figured lets try it out to see if maybe its now better than it used to be. Big let down. The food was mediocre to just plain bad. My wife ordered the scallops which came out still raw and had to be sent back. I tried the Filet Mignon special and it was nothing special the steak was ok not that much flavor to it and the mashed potatoes it came with were bland i mean a greasy spoon diner can make tastier potatoes. My advice is keep on driving by don't stop.
billCarmel_NewYork|80C16101FB4733C8E3747B5B47A08E4D|Hotel|Punta Cana: Paradisus Punta Cana Resort|4| “Great start to summer vaction ”|review_283941816|Ok lets start by saying the grounds are beautiful, the garden setting is quite different from most resorts we have stayed at in the past. The rooms are nicely appointed and beds are comfortable. But you really won't be spending much time in the room anyway. The pools and beach are the reason for going on vaction.The beach is very relaxing and i have to say visit the beach bar by the scuba shop the bartender Juan B was the best, making you feel like you were at home at your local pub. Paradisus does not disappoint in that respect. We have been here 3 days now and feel at home the staff is very friendly and accomodating one word of advice brush up on your spanish altough most staff speak english some have a hard time but will quickly get someone to translate. The food has been very good and the buffet was surprisingly excellent. With several different restaurants offering different fares there is something for everyone. Reservations are highly recommended for the non buffet restaurants, you are provided with a form at check in to fill out to hand in with your requests. We can recommend the following, Bana (Asian ), mole (mexican) , the grill (steakhouse ). We have 3 more days in paradise and looking foward to it.
billCarmel_NewYork|80C16101FB4733C8E3747B5B47A08E4D|Restaurant|Mahopac: Kobu Asian Bistro|3| “TINA WORST SERVER EVER...GO ELSE WHERE.”|review_275835841|Am currently here and I have to say our server tina is the worst server we have ever had. She brings the sushi but not the soy sauce cups/plates we had to ask another waitress for them...then my son ordered ton katsu but she brings chicken katsu even though she asked him previously chicken or pork n he said pork. Food was ok nothing to rave about sushi is smaller pieces than previous visits. When done with the meal it took forever to get the check she kept passing but ignoring our table I had to get another server to get the check and box our left overs. I could understand if they were busy but there were empty tables. My advice is go elsewhere its not as good as when first opened.

First the location was perfect very central to most of the wineries on the east side of Seneca lake so your not spending lots of time in your car. The rooms are very comfy and restful. There is ample space to kick back and relax and wind down after a day out. Breakfast is served from 9-10 am and it is worth the wait, both mornings we had restaurant quality breakfasts served as if you were at grandma's house.

The place seems just to draw crowds, the drunken crowds which takes away from it. The wines were average for the area nothing note worthy, my advise skip it and save yourself some time and a headache.

The food is consistently good and the variety on the menu is great. There is something for every taste. The staff is always very friendly and attentive. The mac and cheese bites are a hit with the kids. I love their fried calamari which is topped with diced peppers. Their burgers are great and they have an entire page of specialty sandwiches as well as other entrees from pasta to fish to steaks and chops.

The Endeavor is in the center of the exhibit allowing you to walk all around and under it. You can get a real up close look even seeing the individual tiles underneath.

The steaks are simply amazing, and the staff friendly and knowledgeable. We tried the fried calimari with hot peppers it was a great dish to start off with. My wife had the sea bass and I had a perfectly cooked delmonico cut steak. They Also have an extensive wine list that I loveMy wife had Been to several of their locations on business and has raved about the chain. We went for our wedding anniversary and they had a table decorated with hearts and a card signed by the staff. For desert they wrote happy anniversary in chocolate on the platter with our desert.
billCarmel_NewYork|80C16101FB4733C8E3747B5B47A08E4D|Restaurant|Mahopac: il Laghetto|1| “Worst night out in ages”|review_205134906|We have been there on several occasions in the past 2 years, including mothers day, and have never had a bad experience, so we went there to celebrate mothers day with family, had dinner reservations for 6 pm for table of 4 got there at 6 pm and still had to wait 15 minutes for a table to be prepared even though there were other tables available, and it just got worse from there. The music was so loud you felt that you were in a club and not a restaurant, I couldn't even here the waiter tell us what the specials were he had to repeat himself several times. The waiter told us what was available and not on the limited menu which seemed smaller than in the past. We started with calamari as we had had this in the past and was always great, well the order was about half the size as before, very disappointing. My kids both ordered burgers and fries, both ordered medium, when the order came there were no fries, but home made mashed potatoes, we asked they said they were out of fries,, confusing since they had home made mashed potatoes, i don't know maybe the could of said something before bringing the plates out. I don't know how a place runs out of french fries when they have potatoes on hand, my sons burger was rare not medium, it was sent back and what came back wasn't edible so all he ate was the mashed potatoes which he said were very good. I ordered a steak medium rare,at about $30.00 what i got was a strip steak well done, and they didn't even give me a steak knife and it was tuff and no flavor, not worth the price. Over all it was a very dissatisfying experience and not worth the price or the time. I understand on days like mothers day can be hectic but they should be prepared for that, it just seems that the place has had a turn for the worse it used to be a hidden gem. I am a firm believer in you get what you pay for, but here unfortunately you are not getting what you pay for. My advice is to go else where for dinner as this place has gone down the tubes.
billCarmel_NewYork|80C16101FB4733C8E3747B5B47A08E4D|Restaurant|Mahopac: Countryside Kitchen|5| “Gastronomical Adventure”|review_204997218|Went there on the recommendations of friends and was not disappointed. The menu is great. If you like pan cakes this is the place they are the size of hub caps ..and they have every type you can imagine and then some..canoli pan cakes ...cake batter pancakes ..nutella and coconuts pan cakes ...buy they had me a the item called the "Pig Pen"..home fries covered with home made chili, fresh Bacon cubes, hot and sweet peppers, with a blanket of melted Cheddar and topped with two eggs. A return trip is in need to this place.

The location is a bit odd in an office park type of setting. But the restaurant itself is clean, modern and the menu was great, a little something for everyone. We tried the duck spring rolls and the fresh Bacon and deviled eggs both were amazing. I had the cowboy ribeye which I have to say was one of the better steaks I have had in the area. I would definitely recommend this place. Would love to try the elk osso bucco on my next visit.

Hotel is located right downtown and close to shopping and restaurants. Best feature of the resort is the private island with two sections, adults only and family sections. With ferry service every 15 minutes from within the hotel, yes they have a dock in the hotel. The wait staff were amazing and attentive. We went the all inclusive route which was great to do no worries at check out. The all inclusive also offers more premium alcohols than other places that limit you to bottom shelf vodkas,runs,gins n etc..Bombay gin was available as was Bacardi runs, and premium whiskey.

There was price restrictions on what you could get but that turned out not to be a big deal since 90% of the menu falls in with the price restrictions. They did charge a 20% trip but the service I felt was worth it. Every staff member there was great.

The wait staff was great and very personable, and that set the tone for a great meal. The menu was very good,not to mention the pretzel croissants that were served. The grilled octopus appetizer was just amazing, as was the strip steak I had and my wife's sea bass was done to perfection.

The staff is very friendly and attentive and make you feel at home. I had the T-Bone which was very full of flavor and cooked to perfection. They have an assortment of sides and appetizers to choose from. The prices are very reasonable as well.

The menu is rather large which may contribute to the average quality of the food..the best part was the view.
